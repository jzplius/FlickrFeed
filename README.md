Features of an app:

	* The app is tested on various devices screens: with real LG L7 II phone, Galaxy Nexus 7 (2013) 
	and lost of other AVD devices. Created 4 different dimensions sets for: default qualifiers, 
	large phones, 1200 px width-sized ones (like Nexus 7) and xhdpi density-sized screens.
	* It shows a list of flickr photo feeds grouped by block of 4 feeds.
	* On item in list clicked original-sized photo is displayed. Photo can be zoomed by 
	crossing and double tapping. If original-sized photo is too large to display (larger than 4000x3200px), 
	up to 1024px size photo is downloaded and shown instead.
	* A stylized search bar lets submit tags, on which to filter feed by.
	* Added internet connection handling. If no internet is present and user commits activity 
	(f.e. clicks back or on item), he is redirected to informational screen which waits while connection is present.
